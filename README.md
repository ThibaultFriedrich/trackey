# tracky
Very cool tracking tool

> You may delay, but time will not. Benjamin Franklin

## Use case

A developer needs to track his time but most of the time, he forgets until his boss reminds him it.
And even if he would have been very assiduous, he only has an ugly useless spreadsheet with hundreds
of lines.

With tracky, he triggers the tracky system when we begins to work and when he ends. If he forgets,
he is notified the tomorrow morning. He also has a spreadsheet with exhaustive previous tracked
times and a dashboard displaying most significant tasks.

It could be useful to propose a way to optimize his habits.

It might also be used for full daily life.
